Hallo, Guten Tag!!!!

Welcome to my practice website... This is to train and showcase my skills on fullstack web development. I have a combination of Java Spring boot as backend.
The database is PostGreSql, which is followed by react vite frontend in typscript.. 
The website showcases auth with REST API calls also some basic css with routing 
The style of the website is heavily inspired based on Neo Brutalism UI which emphasizes mainly on colours , i hope you all like it. Open to comments for improvement.
